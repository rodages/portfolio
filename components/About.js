                <h3>Personal Profile</h3>
                <p>
                I am a Junior Full-Stack Software Engineer specialising in Web Development with React, JavaScript, CSS and HTML, confident with Node, relational database - PostgreSQL and NoSQL database â€“ MongoDB.
I have six years of experience in a Management role at Hornblower which allowed me to gain skills in time management, task delegation, coaching and leadership by leading a team of over 20 individuals to exceed the sales budget and achieving the highest Net Promoter Scores for dining from all companies portfolios.
I have recently graduated from Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp at General Assembly. The course helped me to strengthen previously acquired full-stack skills and apply learned knowledge in a real-life environment at work.
